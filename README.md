 • C++ for Computer Science and Data Structures and Algorithms  

- 🌱 I’m currently learning  
 • Language: Typescript, C++  
 • Framework: React, ExpressJs  
 • DB: MongoDB  
 
- 🌐 mainly developing on WSL Ubuntu and VS Code environment
              
- 💞️ Activity  
 • Helsiki University's Full Stack open 2022-3
 • Colt Steele's The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022 on Udemy  
 • Colt Steele's The Git & Github Bootcamp on Udemy  

As self taught programmer, I am sure that I would complete the Full Stack open course until 2023.07.01(?!).
Through this course I solve many errors by myself and learn fullstack web development.
This course's code is on my github. It would also cover typescript, React Native, CI/CD, Container and Relational Databases.
