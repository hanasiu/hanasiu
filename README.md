- 💞️ Activity  
 • Helsiki University's Full Stack open 2022-3  
 • Colt Steele's The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022 on Udemy  
 • Colt Steele's The Git & Github Bootcamp on Udemy  

As a self-taught programmer, I am confident that I will complete the Full Stack Open course by July 1, 2023. So far, I have been able to solve many errors on my own and have gained a solid understanding of full-stack web development through the course. I have uploaded the code for the course onto my GitHub profile. In the future, I plan to cover additional topics such as TypeScript, React Native, continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), containerization, and relational databases, which are also covered in the course.
